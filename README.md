# Homebrew Leftover Scanner
Use rules from Homebrew Cask to scan for leftover files from uninstalled software.

3413 casks are supported now.

Currently an MVP version, TODO list:

- Support detecting `launchctl` and `login_item`

Known issues:

- JetBrains' IDEs will be detected as uninstalled if you install them via JetBrains Toolbox

## Install & Usages

Install via `brew tap`:

```
brew tap jysperm/leftover-scanner
brew tap homebrew/cask --force # If you haven't tapped before (Homebrew don't do this by default since 4.0)
```

Run it:

```
brew scan-leftovers
```

This script doesn't actually delete files, you can follow the instructions in the output to run `brew uninstall` (at your own risk):

```
$ brew scan-leftovers

### Full Disk Access
Full Disk Access is required for this script to scan paths across the entire file system.

Please enable Full Disk Access for your terminal under System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Full Disk Access.

## About the rules
Most Homebrew casks have a `zap` section, it contains the cache files or logs of that software which can be deleted when you are no longer using it.

However `brew` doesn't delete these files by default, so the `zap` section may not be well maintained. If you find any issues, you can contribute to the official [homebrew-cask](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask) repository.

```
$ brew cat bitbar
cask "bitbar" do
  version "1.10.1"
  sha256 "8a7013dca92715ba80cccef98b84dd1bc8d0b4c4b603f732e006eb204bab43fa"

  url "https://github.com/matryer/bitbar/releases/download/v#{version}/BitBar.app.zip"
  name "BitBar"
  desc "Utility to display the output from any script or program in the menu bar"
  homepage "https://github.com/matryer/bitbar/"

  app "BitBar.app"

  zap trash: [
    "~/Library/BitBar Plugins",
    "~/Library/Caches/com.matryer.BitBar",
    "~/Library/Preferences/com.matryer.BitBar.plist",
  ]
end
```
